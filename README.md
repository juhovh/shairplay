Shairplay
=========
Free portable AirPlay server implementation similar to [ShairPort](https://github.com/abrasive/shairport).

Currently only AirPort Express emulation is supported.

Installation
------------

First you need to install some dependencies, for example on Ubuntu you would
write:
```
sudo apt-get install autoconf automake libtool
sudo apt-get install libltdl-dev libao-dev libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev
sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon
```

```
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

Notice that libao is required in order to install the shairplay binary,
otherwise only the library is compiled and installed.

### Fairplay handshake support

The library has experimental support for handling fairplay handshake (used in
for example screen mirroring) using a playfair library that is licensed under
GPLv3. This can be enabled by adding ```--with-playfair``` to the
```./configure``` command above.

Usage
-----

Check available options with ```shairplay --help```:

```
Usage: shairplay [OPTION...]

  -a, --apname=AirPort            Sets Airport name
  -p, --password=secret           Sets password
  -o, --server_port=5000          Sets port for RAOP service
      --ao_driver=driver          Sets the ao driver (optional)
      --hwaddr=address            Sets the MAC address, useful if running multuple instances
      --ao_devicename=devicename  Sets the ao device name (optional)
      --ao_deviceid=id            Sets the ao device id (optional)
  -h, --help                      This help
```

Start the server with ```shairplay```, if you are connected to a Wi-Fi the
server should show as an AirPort Express on your iOS devices and Mac OS X
computers in the same network.

Notice that you need to have the [airport.key](airport.key) file in your working directory when
starting the shairplay service. It is not included in the binary for possible
legal reasons.

Multiple Instances
------------------

Shairplay advertises over mDNS in the form 485D607CEE22@Dining Room Speakers where 485D607CEE22 is a MAC address. This is hardcoded to a nonsense value, which is not a problem so long as it's unique. However, if you run multiple Shairplay instances, iOS devices will only recognize one of them. To fix this, supply the --hwaddr option with different values on each device.
